What to do if the chosen product is the "best" available

Random product chosing, to avoid having always the same "best" product (or one product will always be the chosen substitute)

The program should be able to retrieve data from a csv or the api.

1. Clean the CSV file with specified parameters: (code, url, product_name, brands, stores, traces_fr, nutrition_grade_fr, main_category_fr, energy_100g, fat_100g, saturated-fat_100g, carbohydrates_100g, sugars_100g, fiber_100g, proteins_100g, salt_100g)
2. Read the CSV file
3. Put each category name in the "categories" database
4. Put stores and brands in their corresponding table
4. Put each product in the "products" database with links to brands stores and categories
5.
