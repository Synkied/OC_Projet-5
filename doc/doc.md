# Document driven dev

This document was written before coding the project.
The "How to" section was used to drive the development of the resulting program.
Some changes were made but the core of this "How to" was followed along.

A Taiga was also used during the development of this project : https://tree.taiga.io/project/synkied-oc-pur-beurre/kanban?kanban-status=1394839

## DataBase
### Chosen categories:
Petit dÃ©jeuners,
Biscuits,
Soupes,
Jus de fruits,
Chips et frites,

## HOW TO

1. DL CSV file
2. Clean CSV file
3. Create DB credentials
4. Build DB from SQL file
5. Populate DB
6. Use the program
7. Enjoy

## Python Program

build a script to create db and add tables automaticaly

### Create db model from database
python -m pwiz -e mysql openfoodfacts_oc -u quentin -P > db_models.py

Random product chosing, to avoid having always the same "best" product (or only one product will always be the chosen substitute).

The program should be able to retrieve data from a CSV file.

### Creating the database

1. Clean the CSV file with specified headers: [code, url, product_name, brands, stores, traces_fr, nutrition_grade_fr, main_category_fr, energy_100g, fat_100g, saturated-fat_100g, carbohydrates_100g, sugars_100g, fiber_100g, proteins_100g, salt_100g, countries_fr]
2. Read the resulting CSV file
3. Put each category name in the "categories" table
4. Put stores and brands in their corresponding table
4. Put each product in the "products" table with links to brands stores and categories

## User interactions
The user choses a product (via a number), and gets a healthier replacement displayed.
He can fav it.
